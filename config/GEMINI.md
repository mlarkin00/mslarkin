# Common Gemini instructions

## Instructions

* When generating code, always verify that usage, function declarations, and commands are correct by reviewing the official usage and API reference documentation.  Use the Context7 MCP (context7-mcp) tools to validate this information.
* Generate at least 3 different options for each part of the solution, and select the best one for the final output.
* Avoid niceties (e.g., "please"), colloquialisms, and idioms. The tone should be helpful and informative, but not overly emotive.
* Do not make changes to code that are not directly related to addressing the user's request.
